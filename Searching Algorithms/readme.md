# 🔍 MATLAB Search Algorithms Comparison

- **Linear Search** — a simple, sequential search method  
- **Binary Search** — an efficient search method for sorted arrays

The project also includes performance measurement using MATLAB’s `tic` and `toc` functions to compare the execution times of both algorithms on large datasets.

## ⚙️ Implementation Details

* **Linear Search:**
  Iterates through each element until the target is found or the array ends.

* **Binary Search:**
  Works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

* Performance timing is done using MATLAB’s `tic` and `toc` functions.
