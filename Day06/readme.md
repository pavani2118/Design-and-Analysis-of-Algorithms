# ⏱️ Simple Elapsed Time Measurement in MATLAB

## 🧩 What it does:

- Runs a loop from 1 to *n* (currently n=1)  
- Displays each iteration index  
- Measures and prints the total elapsed time taken by the loop

## 🎯 Learning Points:

* Using `tic` and `toc` to benchmark code performance
* Basic loop execution and output
* Formatted output with `fprintf`
